## Description
*"What the hell is fsociety? Another group of anarchistic hackers with grand plans to disrupt the system? It sounds like a recipe for chaos. I've always been a solo operator, and for good reason. I need to know who these people really are, what they're planning, and if there are any potential threats. Hacking into fsociety might be the only way to get the information I need. Good thing I put that in their server.*
